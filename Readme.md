# Signal
## Description
The code is designed to test the capabilities of POSIX signals in Linux. The program creates a child process and communicates with it. Information is transmitted via SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR1, as a sequence of 0 and 1. De facto synchronization is carried out on the signals

I express my gratitude to Morgen Matvey (@Melges) for the idea and description of the implementation
